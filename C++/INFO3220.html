						<h1>Overview</h1>
						<p>This week your goals should be to become familiar with using <a href="http://qt-project.org/wiki/Category:Tools::QtCreator">Qt Creator</a> as an IDE for C++ development by building a series of console applications. You will be introduced to the inheritance model in C++, which is an important component when building the graphical applications that you will start next week.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="section2">
						<h1>About the Course</h1>
						<p>Before you get started though welcome to INFO3220. This unit of study introduces core design methodologies and language mechanisms for successful object-oriented design. The language used for development is C++ as it allows for the exploration of the underlying features of a the design patterns which will be covered in this course which is not possible when using higher level languages such as Java and Python.</p>

						<div class="alert alert-danger"><h4>Warning!</h4> If you are aiming to do well in this course it is important that you have already completed this courseâ€™s two prerequisites: <a href="http://cusp.sydney.edu.au/students/view-unit-page/alpha/COMP2129" class="alert-link">COMP2129</a> and <a href="http://cusp.sydney.edu.au/students/view-unit-page/alpha/INFO2110" class="alert-link">INFO2110</a>. If you have not completed these two courses you will find it difficult to keep up with the pace of this course.</div>

						This course has two prescribed textbooks which you can purchase from the Co-op Bookshop as a bundle which include:

						<ul>
							<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</a></li>
							<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Primer">C++ Primer</a></li>
						</ul>

						<p>Another book which you may find useful during the course is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C%2B%2B_Programming_Language">The C++ Programming Language</a> which is written by the creator of C++, Bjarne Stroustrup.</p>

						<p>An online resource which complements these books and which will be referenced throughout the course is <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/">cpluplus.com</a>.</p>

						<h2>Tutorials</h2>
						<p>The tutorials for this course are on Monday and Tuesdays. All tutorial exercises will be available through this website.</p>

						<p>Even though you can work through all material in your own time it is important that you attend the tutorial that you have been assigned. This is because assignments will be marked within tutorials by your assigned tutor, along with the in-class quiz. If you can't make it to your assigned tutorial and wish to change to another one discuss this with your tutor <b>this week.</b></p>

						<p>Each tutorial will be in the format seen here and will include a number of common elements: </p>

						<ul>
							<li>an overview of the week including weekly announcements. These announcements may include updates to the assignments (such as an extension or clarification of the assignment specifications), along with further information about the content from the previous weeks lecture.</li>
							<li>coding or theory questions which may or may not include group work.</li>
							<li>a number of tip boxes which are aimed at bringing your attention to important details that you might miss. One of which you have already seen. The four tip boxes are:
							<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
							<li><div class="alert alert-warning"><h4>Note</h4>This is something you should be aware of; it may save you time or prevent confusion later.</div></li>
							<li><div class="alert alert-success"><h4>Hint</h4>This is a hint that could help you complete the exercise.</div></li>
							<li><div class="alert alert-info"><h4>Info</h4>This is some extra information, in case you are interested.</div></li>
							<li><div class="alert alert-danger"><h4>Warning!</h4>Be careful â€“ this is something important that you should be wary of!</div></li>
							</ul>
							</li>
							<li>a way to check if you have successfully completed the tutorial: you can check your output is the same as a set of expected values (e.g. today's tutorial), compare the graphical output (e.g. week 3) or a testing file may be provided which will automatically validate your code (e.g. week 5).</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Assessments</h2>

						<p>This course includes the following three assessments</p>

						<h3>The Assignment</h3>

						<p>This years assignment will be the implemention of a space invaders computer game using QtCreator. This assignment will be broken into three sections.</p>

						<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
							<li>Stage 1: Lonely space ship game (worth 5%)</li>
							<li>Stage 2: Add shooting aliens (worth 15%)</li>
							<li>Stage 3: Add more features (worth 10%)</li>
						</ul>

						<p>For the complete assignment guidelines refer to the first lecture (Administration and Introductions)</p>

						<div class="alert alert-warning"><h4>Note</h4>It is important to note that to receive your demonstration mark for each assignment you must attend your assigned tutorial the week the assignment is due. The assignment, however, must be submitted on eLearning before the due deadline (10am Monday) to be eligible for the demonstration.</div>

						<p>As you will be demonstrating your code in class it is important that your code compiles using Qt Creator 5, as this is what is installed on the lab computers.</p>

						<h3>What you can expect to have by the end of Stage 3</h3>

						<p>One of the assignment in the last years was the implementation of the classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_%28video_game%29">Brick Break game</a>. Below is a video demo of a Stage 3 submission.</p>

						<div class="alert alert-danger"><h4>Warning!</h4>This video has been posted using HTML 5. If it does not work for you consider updating your web browser. For more details on the video tag in html 5 click the following <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_video.asp">link</a>.</div>

						<h2>Tools</h2>

						<h3>eLearning</h3>

						<p>All the lecture notes for the course are available through <a href="https://elearning.sydney.edu.au/">eLearning</a>. We will aim to update these once a week after the Friday Lecture.</p>

						<p>eLearning will also be used for assignment submissions for this course. It will be this copy that will be used to demonstrate your assignment in class.</p>						

						<h3>Tutorial Site</h3>

						<p>This <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/it/courses/info3220/tutorial2.html#section1">website</a> will include all the material you need for all the tutorial exercises. It is designed to allow you to continue working on the exercises outside of class but you will benefit most from completing the exercises in the labs.</p>

						<h3>Qt Creator</h3>

						<p>All the assignments and tutorials will be developed in Qt Creator. This IDE was chosen due to its extensive cross platform support which includes Linux, OS X and Windows. Qt Creator is installed on all SIT lab machines and is also freely available for download <a href="http://qt-project.org/wiki/Category:Tools::QtCreator">here</a>.</p>

					</div>	
					<div id="section3">
						<h1>Command line application development in Qt</h1>

						<p>The first application you are going to write in Qt is the same as the first program you wrote in Java which is, Hello World! This is to ensure that all the libraries are working as expected and that the settings are correct for building multi-class applications.</p>

						<h2>Set up a project in Qt</h2>

						<p>Before you get started developing your first C++ application, lets start by setting up a project in QtCreator. First open QtCreator which can be found in the start menu.</p>

						<div class="wrappedImage"><img id="expandableImage1" src="./INFO3220_files/NewProject.jpg" alt="Project Setup"></div>
						<p>Once QtCreator is open you will be greeted by the getting started pane. </p> 

						<p>This includes links to a number of useful tutorials and examples which may help you become familiar with the built in Qt libraries, particular for user interface development. The tutorials may be useful when working on your assignment although it would be better to complete <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/it/courses/info3220/tutorial3.html">next week's lab</a> before attempting these tutorials in your own time. </p>

						<p>For now lets focus on developing a simple console application in C++. To do this first create a new project by clicking the rather oversized <b>new project</b> button in the centre, through the file menu, or by using the shortcut Ctrl-N.</p>

						<br>

						<div class="wrappedImage"><img id="expandableImage2" src="./INFO3220_files/ConsoleApplicationSelection.jpg" alt="Project Setup2"></div>

						<p> Once you have selected a new project you will need to select what type of project you will be constructing. It is important to select the appropriate style of project at this point of development as each project type includes a specialised project configuration file depending on the settings selected.</p>

						<p>For today you will be creating a Qt Console application project which can be seen selected in the Figure to the right.</p>

						<div class="alert alert-info"><h4>Info</h4>This is the project type you should use for all tutorials unless other instructions are provided.</div>

						<br>

						<div class="wrappedImage"><img id="expandableImage3" src="./INFO3220_files/ProjectCreation.jpg" alt="Project Setup3"></div>

						<p>After selecting the Qt Console application project you will need to provide a project name. Create a folder on your <b>new</b> U drive called INFO3220, or some variant, and name this project HelloWorld</p>

						<p>Once you have created this project by clicking next leave all the remaining settings as default and continue pressing next until you can select finish.</p>

						<p>Try running the application which has been created by pressing the large green arrow in the bottom left corner. If a console appears then Qt is working as expected.</p>

						<h2>Check all is working with Hello World!</h2>

						<p>Now update your main class to match the following code.</p>

						<pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
	std::cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World!" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
	return 0;
}						
						</pre>

						<p>When you run your application this time you should find that it prints <b>Hello World!</b> and that you can press enter to terminate the program.</p>

						<div class="alert alert-info"><h4>Info</h4>As you continue to write C++ programs you may find that you don't want to write <code>std::</code> in front of every method you call from the STL; such as <code>std::cout</code>, <code>std::cin</code> or <code>std::endl</code>. To avoid this you can write <code>using namespace std;</code> at the top of you implementation file. Make sure that you never do this in your header files!</div>

					</div>
					<div id="section4">
						<h1>Inheritance in C++</h1>
						<p>Now that you know how to create a project in Qt you're ready to move on to a multi-class application. To do this first create a second C++ Console Application in Qt Creator. This project should be called 'Vehicles'. In this project you are going to implement the inheritance structure seen below.</p>

						<br>

						<img class="diagram" src="./INFO3220_files/Vehicles.jpg" alt="Vehicles Diagram" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

						<br>

						<p>Each of these objects will be written as a class.</p>

						<div class="alert alert-info">
							<h4>Info</h4>
							Unlike Java, C++ does not have an interface or abstract keyword; rather you can create abstract classes and interfaces using pure virtual methods.
						</div>

						<p>Use the follow skeleton code to help with this exercise. You will need to create the following files to complete this task. <b>Vehicle.h</b>, <b>MotorVehicle.h</b>, <b>Bus.h</b>, <b>Bus.cpp</b>, <b>Car.h</b>, <b>Car.cpp</b>, <b>Bicycle.h</b>, <b>Bicycle.cpp</b></p>

						<h2>Building the Abstract Classes</h2>

						<p>First you will need to create the abstract classes. For these classes you only need header files. Only the concrete classes will need implementation (.cpp) files.</p>

						<p>The <b>Vehicle</b> class should include the following methods</p>

						<pre>#include &lt;string&gt;

namespace week02 {
	class Vehicle {
	public:
		Vehicle(int numberOfPassengers, 
			int topSpeed, 
			int numberOfWheels, 
			std::string color = "red");

		virtual ~Vehicle();

		virtual std::string getColor();

		virtual int getTopSpeed();

		virtual int getNumberOfWheels();

		virtual int getNumberOfPassengers();

		virtual int getSafetyRating() = 0;

	protected:
		int m_numberOfPassengers;
		int m_topSpeed;
		int m_numberOfWheels;
		std::string m_color;
	};	
}	
						</pre>

						<div class="alert alert-warning">
							<h4>Note</h4>
							A method that is marked virtual and equal to 0 is called a pure virtual method, such as the <code>getSafetyRating()</code> in the Vehicle class. This type of method behaves in a similar way to a method marked abstract in Java. 
						</div>						

						<p>The <b>MotorVehicle</b> class should include the following methods and should publicly inherit from Vehicle </p>

						<pre>#include "Vehicle.h"

namespace week02 {
	class MotorVehicle : public Vehicle {
	public:
		MotorVehicle(int numberOfPassengers,
			int topSpeed, 
			int numberOfWheels, 
			double kilometresPerLitre);

		MotorVehicle(int numberOfPassengers,
			int topSpeed, 
			int numberOfWheels, 
			std::string color, 
			double kilometresPerLitre);

		virtual ~MotorVehicle();

		virtual double getKilometresPerLitre();

	protected:
		double m_kmpl;
	};
}
						</pre>

						<div class="alert alert-warning">
							<h4>Note</h4>
							In C++ we have three types of inheritance. Public, Protected and Private inheritance. Each of these will cause the inheritance behaviour to change. So be careful which one you choose.
						</div>

						<p>Although you have been provided the scaffold for the following two abstract classes all but the <code>getSafetyRating()</code> methods need to be implemented. This therefore means that you need to write the appropriate constructors, destructors and getter methods for the member variables of each class. Each constructor should be implemented using an initialisation list. If you are unfamiliar with this syntax it is as follows.</p>

						<pre>Constructor(int variable1, int variable2) 
    : m_variable1(variable1)
    , m_variable2(variable2)
						</pre>

						<p>The destructors for each class should be empty methods and the getters should simply return the member variables which they match to.</p>

						<h2>Building the Concrete Classes</h2>

						<p>There are a couple of things which are important to remember when implementing the three concrete classes in this exercise. All three should be in the week02 namespace. As you are required to create both a header (.h) and implementation (.cpp) file for each of these classes, ensure that your implementation includes the <code>using namespace week02;</code> statement in each file.</p>

						<h3>The Car class</h3>

						<p>The first class you should build is the <b>Car</b> class. To do this add a class in Qt Creator which will create both the header (.h) and implementation (.cpp) files. The car class should publically inherit the <b>MotorVehicle</b> class and should have two new variables <code>m_numberOfAirBags</code> and <code>m_abs</code> which indicate the number of airbags in a car and whether the car as an automatic braking system respectively. The Car class constructor should match the method signatures seen below after incorporating these two additional variables. </p>

						<pre>Car(int numberOfPassengers, 
	int topSpeed, 
	double kilometresPerLitre, 
	int numberOfAirBags = 2, 
	bool abs = true, 
	int numberOfWheels = 4);

Car(int numberOfPassengers, 
	int topSpeed, 
	double kilometresPerLitre, 
	std::string color, 
	int numberOfAirBags = 2, 
	bool abs = true, 
	int numberOfWheels = 4);    
						</pre>

						<p>Once you have set up your constructors you now need to implement the getSafetyRating() method which should match the following.</p>

						<pre>int Car::getSafetyRating() {
    int safetyRating = 0;
    if (m_numberOfAirBags &gt;= 4) {
        safetyRating += 3;
    } else if (m_numberOfAirBags &gt;= 2) {
        safetyRating += 2;
    } else if (m_numberOfAirBags &gt; 0) {
        safetyRating += 1;
    }

    if (m_abs) {
        safetyRating += 2;
    }
    return safetyRating;
}						
						</pre>

						<h3>The Bus class</h3>

						<p>The next class to implement is the <b>Bus</b> Class. Follow the same steps used to build the <b>Car</b> class except that the two additional variables required for a bus are <code>m_seatBeltsInstalled</code> and <code>m_standingPassengersAllowed</code> which indicate whether a bus has seat belts installed and whether the bus allows for standing passengers respectively. These two additional variables can be used to implement the following two constructors for the bus class.</p>

						<pre> Bus(int numberOfPassengers, 
	int topSpeed, 
	double kilometresPerLitre, 
	bool seatBeltsInstalled = false, 
	bool standingPassengersAllowed = true, 
	int numberOfWheels = 6);
 
 Bus(int numberOfPassengers, 
	int topSpeed, 
	double kilometresPerLitre, 
	std::string color, 
	bool seatBeltsInstalled = false, 
	bool standingPassengersAllowed = true, 
	int numberOfWheels = 6);
        
						</pre>

						<p>Once you have set up your constructors you now need to implement the <code>getSafetyRating()</code> method which should match the following.</p>

						<pre>int Bus::getSafetyRating() {
    int safetyRating = 0;

    if (m_seatBeltsInstalled) {
        safetyRating += 3;
    }
    if (!m_standingPassengersAllowed) {
        safetyRating += 2;
    }
    return safetyRating;
}					
						</pre>						

						<h3>The Bicycle class</h3>

						<p>the last class to implement is the <b>Bicycle</b> Class. Unlike the previous two vehicles a Bicycle is not a motor vehicle so therefore it should only inherit from the <b>Vehicle</b> class. The Bicycle class has a single additional variable which is the <code>m_helmetUsed</code> to indicate if the rider of the bike is using a helmet. Similar to the previous two classes Bicycle has two constructors which have the following method signatures.</p>

						<pre>Bicycle(int numberOfPassengers, 
	int topSpeed, 
	bool helmetUsed = false, 
	int numberOfWheels = 2);

Bicycle(int numberOfPassengers, 
	int topSpeed, 
	std::string color, 
	bool helmetUsed = false, 
	int numberOfWheels = 2);
						</pre>	

						<p>Once you have set up your constructors you now need to implement the <code>getSafetyRating()</code> method which should match the following.</p>

						<pre>int Bicycle::getSafetyRating() {
    if (m_helmetUsed) {
        return 5;
    } else {
        return 0;
    }
}				
						</pre>							

						<h2>Testing it all works</h2>

						<p>Once you have implemented the three concrete classes along with the two abstract classes replace the code in the main.cpp of the Qt Creator application with the following code.</p>

						<pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

#include "Bicycle.h"
#include "Bus.h"
#include "Car.h"

using namespace week02;

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {

	Bicycle bicycle1(1, 15);
	Bicycle bicycle2(1, 10, std::string("Blue"));
	Bicycle bicycle3(1, 15, true);
	Bicycle bicycle4(1, 10, std::string("Yellow"), true);
	Bicycle bicycle5(1, 15, true, 3);
	Bicycle bicycle6(1, 10, std::string("Green"), true, 3);

	std::cout &lt;&lt; bicycle1.getSafetyRating() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
	std::cout &lt;&lt; bicycle2.getSafetyRating() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
	std::cout &lt;&lt; bicycle3.getSafetyRating() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
	std::cout &lt;&lt; bicycle4.getSafetyRating() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
	std::cout &lt;&lt; bicycle5.getSafetyRating() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
	std::cout &lt;&lt; bicycle6.getSafetyRating() &lt;&lt; std::endl;

	Bus bus1(1, 75, 10, true, false);
	Bus bus2(1, 75, 10, std::string("Blue"), true, true);
	Bus bus3(1, 75, 10);
	Bus bus4(1, 75, 10, false, true);

	std::cout &lt;&lt; bus1.getSafetyRating() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
	std::cout &lt;&lt; bus2.getSafetyRating() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
	std::cout &lt;&lt; bus3.getSafetyRating() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
	std::cout &lt;&lt; bus4.getSafetyRating() &lt;&lt; std::endl;

	Car car1(1, 75, 10, 4);
	Car car2(1, 75, 10, std::string("Blue"));
	Car car3(1, 75, 10);
	Car car4(1, 75, 10, 6, true, 4);
	Car car5(1, 75, 10, std::string("Green"), 6, true, 4);
    
	std::cout &lt;&lt; car1.getSafetyRating() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
	std::cout &lt;&lt; car2.getSafetyRating() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
	std::cout &lt;&lt; car3.getSafetyRating() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
	std::cout &lt;&lt; car4.getSafetyRating() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
	std::cout &lt;&lt; car5.getSafetyRating() &lt;&lt; std::endl;

	return 0;
}
						</pre>

						<p>Once your application compiles, run it and see if its output matches the output below. If it does then you have implemented the Bicycle, Bus and Car classes successfully.</p>
